Check done by tools/checklist.csh
=================================
Prototypes in .cpp files? Move to headers!

C's malloc or free used anywhere?

C++ new or delete used anywhere?

C++ fstream, iostream, cout used anywhere?

System headers included directly in cpp files, instead of via common_magma.h?
(There are a few exceptions allowed.)

CUDA or CUBLAS functions used without MAGMA wrappers?
(Some don't have wrappers yet.)

Any instances of (N+nb-1)/nb, etc. creep back in (ceildiv, roundup)?

Style guide compliance (spaces, etc.)


Manual checking of code
=================================
All new functions documented accurately?

All new functions in testing/run_tests.py?
All new functions in sparse-iter/testing/run_tests.py?

All functions pass run_tests.py?


Compilation checks
=================================
Documentation
	cd docs && ./groups.sh -- any groups unused or undefined?
	(currently QUARK undefined; geqrf_tile unused)
	
	cd docs && make
	check errors in output_err

Compile & run with -DNDEBUG (no asserts)
	This is how MathWorks compiles it.

Compile & run on:
	Linux
		icc, gcc
		MKL
		MKL ILP64
		ACML 5 or 6
		OpenBLAS
	MacOS using gcc & veclib
	Windows using CMake & MKL
	
	CUDA 5.0
	CUDA 5.5
	CUDA 6.0
	CUDA 6.5
	CUDA 7.0
	
	pgi compilers?

Any compiler warnings?
