             MAGMA Release Notes
	
-----------------------------------------------------

MAGMA is intended for a single CUDA enabled NVIDIA GPU.  It supports
Tesla and Fermi GPUs. For more details see the MAGMA 1.0 presentation.

Included are routines for the following algorithms:

    * LU, QR, and Cholesky factorizations in both real and complex
      arithmetic (single and double);
    * Hessenberg, bidiagonal, and tridiagonal reductions in both real
      and complex arithmetic (single and double);
    * Linear solvers based on LU, QR, and Cholesky in both real and
      complex arithmetic (single and double);
    * Eigen and singular value problem solvers in both real and
      complex arithmetic (single and double);
    * Mixed-precision iterative refinement solvers based on LU, QR,
      and Cholesky in both real and complex arithmetic;
    * MAGMA BLAS in real arithmetic (single and double), including
      gemm, gemv, symv, and trsm.


 1.0.0RC5 - April 6th, 2011
    * Add fortran interface for lapack functions
    * Add new QR version on GPU ([zcsd]geqrf3_gpu) and corresponding
      LS solver ([zcds]geqrs3_gpu)
    * Add [cz]unmtr, [sd]ormtr functions
    * Add two functions in fortran to compute the offset on device pointers
          magmaf_[sdcz]off1d( NewPtr, OldPtr, inc, i)
          magmaf_[sdcz]off2d( NewPtr, OldPtr, lda, i, j)
        indices are given in Fortran (1 to N)
    * WARNING: add FOPTS variable to the make.inc to use preprocessing
      in compilation of Fortran files
    * WARNING: fix bug with fortran compilers which don;t change the name
      now fortran prefix is magmaf instead of magma
    * Small documentation fixes
    * Fix timing under windows, thanks to Evan Lazar
    * Fix problem when __func__ is not present, thanks to Evan Lazar
    * Fix bug with m==n==0 in LU, thanks to Evan Lazar
    * Fix bug on [cz]unmqr, [sd]ormqr functions
    * Fix bug in [zcsd]gebrd; fixes bug in SVD for n>m
    * Fix bug in [zcsd]geqrs_gpu for multiple RHS
    * Added functionality - zcgesv_gpu and dsgesv_gpu can now solve also 
      A' X = B using mixed-precision iterative refinement
    * Fix error code in testings.h to compile with cuda 4.0

 1.0.0RC4 - March 8th, 2011

    * Add control directory to group all non computational functions
    * Integration of the eigenvalues solvers
    * Clean some f2c code in eigenvalues solvers
    * Arithmetic consistency: cuDoubleComplex and cuFloatComplex are 
      the  only types used for complex now.
    * Consistency of the interface of some functions.
    * Clean most of the return values in lapack functions
    * Fix multiple definition of min, max,
    * Fix headers problem under windows, thanks to Willem Burger
