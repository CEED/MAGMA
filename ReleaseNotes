             MAGMA Release Notes
	
-----------------------------------------------------

MAGMA is intended for a single CUDA enabled NVIDIA GPU.  It supports
Tesla and Fermi GPUs. For more details see the MAGMA 1.0 presentation.

Included are routines for the following algorithms:

    * LU, QR, and Cholesky factorizations in both real and complex
      arithmetic (single and double);
    * Hessenberg, bidiagonal, and tridiagonal reductions in both real
      and complex arithmetic (single and double);
    * Linear solvers based on LU, QR, and Cholesky in both real and
      complex arithmetic (single and double);
    * Eigen and singular value problem solvers in both real and
      complex arithmetic (single and double);
    * Generalized Hermitian-definite eigenproblem solver in both
      real and complex arithmetic (single and double);
    * Mixed-precision iterative refinement solvers based on LU, QR,
      and Cholesky in both real and complex arithmetic;
    * MAGMA BLAS in real arithmetic (single and double), including
      gemm, gemv, symv, and trsm.
