             MAGMA Release Notes

-----------------------------------------------------

MAGMA is intended for CUDA enabled NVIDIA GPUs.  It supports
Tesla, Fermi, and Kepler GPUs. For more details see the MAGMA 1.4 presentation:
http://icl.cs.utk.edu/projectsfiles/magma/pubs/MAGMA_1.4.pdf

Included are routines for the following algorithms:

    * LU, QR, and Cholesky factorizations
    * Hessenberg, bidiagonal, and tridiagonal reductions
    * Linear solvers based on LU, QR, and Cholesky
    * Eigenvalue and singular value (SVD) problem solvers
    * Generalized Hermitian-definite eigenproblem solver
    * Mixed-precision iterative refinement solvers based on LU, QR, and Cholesky
    * MAGMA BLAS including gemm, gemv, symv, and trsm

Most routines have all four precisions:
single (s), double (d), single-complex (c), double-complex (z).

Sparse routines have recently been added as a beta release, in the sparse-iter
directory. We would appreciate any feedback that you may have on them.
