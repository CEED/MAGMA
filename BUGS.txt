Known bugs & issues

These show up when using testing run_tests.py --tol 100.


Aug 2015
[sdcz]trsm_batched                      --  accuracy failures
These result from badly conditioned triangular matrices.
The tester needs to be updated to take the conditioning into account in the check.


Aug 2015
[s c ]geqrf_batched                     --  transient NAN failures
Occasionally gets NaN results, possibly due to race condition.
Under investigation.


Aug 2015
[sdcz]sy/hemm_mgpu                      --  tester incompatability
The tester needs to be updated to match the routine; currently disabled.


Aug 2015
[sd  ]gegqr_gpu --version 3             --  MGS accuracy failure, N=95
[sd  ]gegqr_gpu --version 4             --  Cholesky QR fails (not SPD), N=95
These occur for the same matrix, so are probably related to a deficiency, e.g.,
poor conditioning, in that matrix.
Under investigation.
