* To INSTALL MAGMA, modify the make.inc file to indicate where 
  CUDA, CPU BLAS, and LAPACK are installed on your system. Examples
  are given in make.inc.mkl, make.inc.acml, make.inc.goto, and 
  make.inc.atlas, showing how to link correspondingly to MKL, ACML,
  GOTO BLAS or ATLAS BLAS. After proper modification of the make.inc
  file, typing 'make', will create 
   1) the libmagma.a and libmagmablas.a libraries in directory 'lib'
   2) testing drivers in directory 'testing'.

* To TEST MAGMA, go to directory 'testing'. Provided are a number of
  drivers testing different routines. These drivers are also useful
  as examples on how to use MAGMA, as well as to benchmark the performance.
 
* To TUNE MAGMA, you can modify the blocking factors for the algorithms of
  interest in file 'control/get_nb_{tesla|fermi|kepler}.cpp'. The default 
  values are tuned for general Tesla, Fermi, and Kepler  GPUs. If you have 
  a Fermi (C2050), you can also compare your performance to what we get, 
  given in file 'testing/results_fermi.txt', as an easy check for your 
  installation.

* To RUN EXPERIMENTAL MAGMA, go to directory 'exp' and type 'make'.  Then 
  type 'export NUM_MKL_THREADS=1'.  Next go to directory 'testing'.  
  Provided are drivers testing multi-core Choleskey, QR, and LU; and 
  single GPU all, available CPU cores QR.  Typing a given driver name will 
  result in clear instructions on what to provide on the command line.  

  Note that on some systems the experimental code must be linked against 
  sequential MKL.  If you notice excessively poor performance, change 
  make.inc to link against sequential MKL.

The MAGMA project supports the package in the sense that reports of 
errors or poor performance will gain immediate attention from the 
developers. Such reports, descriptions of interesting applications, 
and other comments should be posted on the MAGMA user forum.
