MAGMA README FILE
==================

VERSION 0.1  :  September 2009
VERSION 0.2  :   November 2009
VERSION 1.0  :   November 2010 

* To INSTALL MAGMA, modify the make.inc file to indicate where 
  CUDA, CPU BLAS, and LAPACK are installed on your system. Examples
  are given in make.inc.mkl, make.inc.acml, make.inc.goto, and 
  make.inc.atlas, showing how to link correspondingly to MKL, ACML,
  GOTO BLAS or ATLAS BLAS. After proper modification of the make.inc
  file, typing 'make', will create 
   1) the libmagma.a and libmagmablas.a libraries in directory 'lib'
   2) testing drivers in directory 'testing'.

* To TEST MAGMA, go to directory 'testing'. Provided are a number of
  drivers testing different routines. These drivers are also useful
  as examples on how to use MAGMA, as well as to benchmark the performance.
 
* To TUNE MAGMA, you can modify the blocking factors for the algorithms of
  interest in file 'src/get_nb.cpp'. The default values are tuned for 
  general Tesla and Fermi GPUs. If you have a Fermi (C2050), you can also 
  compare your performance to what we get, given in file 
  'testing/results_fermi.txt', as an easy check for your installation.

For more INFORMATION, please refer to the MAGMA homepage and user forum:

The MAGMA project supports the package in the sense that reports of 
errors or poor performance will gain immediate attention from the 
developers. Such reports, descriptions of interesting applications, 
and other comments should be posted on the MAGMA user forum.
