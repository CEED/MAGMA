Things to do for wednesday:

 - Update the Makefile to the same comportement as PLASMA, to use the same MakeRelease  script or at least close. (Mathieu)
 - Move some macros from magma.h to another file in src, not use on the user side.
 - Don't include automatically magma_lapack.h in magma.h => add this line of include to amost all files
 - sorgqr_gpu.cpp has to be moved to zungqr_gpu.c 
 - Multi-cores files have to be: moved to complex, updated to the last release of PLASMA, and cleaned.
 - Check all mixed-precision files (zcposv_gpu.cpp, zcgesv_gpu.cpp, zcgetrs_gpu.cpp , zcgeqrsv_gpu.cpp), some files are missing in magmablas.
 - auxiliary.cpp
   zgehrd.cpp, zlahr2.cpp, zlahru.cpp
   zhetrd.cpp, zlatrd.cpp
   ztsqrt_gpu.cpp
   zunmqr.cpp
   zunmtr.cpp
   Clean all these files: - Move from double2 to cuDoubleComplex
                          - Check interface, has to be the same than LAPACK, if they are workspace, they are allocated inside the function.
                          - Clean the char parameters to use the define Magma...[Str]

 - Clean zungqr.cpp, it should be updated regarding the conversion of sorgqr_gpu.cpp
 - Create a MAGMA_Init function
 - Find another way to set all the nb, inside this MAGMA_init o another one and provide the user a way to change it.
