#==============================================================================#


==============
 INSTALLATION 
==============
1) unzip the tar.gz file into some folder

2) "cd magma-x.y.z-lll/"

3) set a symbolic link via 
        "ln -s make.inc.xxx-yyy make.inc" 
   to the most suitable configuration. You may still have to adapt some paths 
   inside.

3) compile magma using "make -j8" (in case you want to use 8 cores...)

4) "cd sparse-iter"

5) compile magma-sparse using "make -j8" (in case you want to use 8 cores...)

6) If no errors show up, everything has worked out fine. 
   In the sparse-iter/testing folder you find example runfiles - for proper
   usage see section below.


==============
 USAGE     
==============

In the sparse-iter/testing folder are simple programs to run the different 
solvers. They all need a matrix in MatrixMarket format (.mtx) as input. 
Test matrices of this type can be downloaded at the University of Florida Matrix 
Collection: http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/matrices/ 

A suitable test matrix is given by Trefethen_2000:

Another option is to generate a 2D Laplace problem of variable size on-the-fly:
'LAPLACE2D 10' generates a 2D Laplacian of size 100x100.

To run a solver:


            ./run_xsolver [ --options ] matrices


Every solver exists in single ("x"=s), double ("x"=d), single-complex and 
double-complex version ("x"=c or z, respectively).


For different solvers there exist different options, which are printed 
when executing "./run_xsolver â€”help.

 Some options are:

 --solver      Possibility to choose a solver
               0   CG
               1   merged CG
               2   preconditioned CG
               3   BiCGSTAB
               4   merged BiCGSTAB
               5   preconditioned BiCGSTAB
               6   GMRES
               7   preconditioned GMRES
               8   LOBPCG
               9   Jacobi
               10  Block-asynchronous Iteration
               21  Iterative Refinement

"--verbose k"
    k = 0 : solver is run in production mode, no additional characteristics 
            monitored
    k > 0 : solver is run in verbose mode, residual and runtime is monitored
            every k iterations

"--format k"
    k = 0 : CSR
    k = 1 : ELLPACK/ELL
    k = 2 : SELL-P

"--blocksize k"
    for Magma_SELL-P: k denotes the number of rows in one slice of the matrix
                      and the number of rows assigned to one multiprocessor

"--alignment k"
    for Magma_SELL-P: k denotes the number of threads assigned to one row
                      notice: blocksize * alignment needs to fit into shared mem

"--maxiter k"
    k : upper bound for iterations

"--tol k"
    k : relative residual stopping criterion (machine precision as default)

"--restart k"
    k : Krylov subspace restart number for GMRES-(k)


"--mscale k"
   k = 0 no scaling
   k = 1 scale symmetrically to unit diagonal

"--preconditioner k"
    k = 0 : No
    k = 1 : Jacobi
    k = 2 : ILU/IC
    Other preconditioners are only available for the Iterative Refinement.

"--ev k"
    k : number of eigenvalue/eigenvectors to compute


The last argument is the traget matrices. These should be stored in MatrixMarket
format, see http://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/formats.html.

The solver info uses the following feedback:
       0          Success.
      -117        Not supported.
      -201        No convergence within iteration limit. 
      -202        No convergence.
      -203        Operator A is not positive definite.
