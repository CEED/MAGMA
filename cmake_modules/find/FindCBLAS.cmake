# This module finds an installed CBLAS library.
# CBLAS is distributed at : 
#
# This module can be tuned for searching in a specific folder:
#  - CBLAS_DIR      : path of the presumed top directory of CBLAS
#               (the library will be searched in this in the first time).
#
#
# This module sets the following variables:
#  - CBLAS_FOUND        : set to true if a library is found.
#
#  - CBLAS_PATH         : path of the top directory of cblas installation.
#  - CBLAS_VERSION      : version of cblas.
#
#  - CBLAS_LDFLAGS      : string of all required linker flags.
#  - CBLAS_LIBRARY      : list of all required library  (absolute path).
#  - CBLAS_LIBRARIES    : list of required linker flags (without -l and -L).
#  - CBLAS_LIBRARY_PATH : path of the library directory of cblas installation.
#
#  - CBLAS_INLCUDE_PATH : path of the include directory of cblas installation.
